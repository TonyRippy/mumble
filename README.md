# Welcome!

This isn't one well-defined project, but a collection of experiments
and my personal playground for trying out some weird (and maybe
wonderful?) ideas in monitoring.

This has nothing to do with [https://mumble.info], the voice-over-IP
chat software.

## Why "Mumble"?

This project started as a way to explore using sketches and other
approximations of monitoring data as a way to reduce storage
costs. The name "mumble" comes from the English word for saying things
indistinctly.

## What if I want to use this stuff?

The code here is not ready for production use.

If ideas seem promising, I will attempt to turn it into something real
and useful. In that case, rather than store the finished product here
I will either attempt to donate it as part of a more established
project or spin it off into a separate repository.
