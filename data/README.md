This directory contains data used to test monitoring concepts, and code used to process those datasets.

## Datasets

I have created the following datasets myself:

## Tools

The following tools were created to assist in preparing experiment data:
- `promhist` - A utility that uses the Prometheus Go client library to generate native histograms from CSV data and write them as serialize protobufs to a local sqlite3 database.
