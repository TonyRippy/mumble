# Architectural Decision Log

This direcory contains a listing of the history of architectural decisions made
in the course of working on this project. This is provided for several reasons:

 - Often, writing things down helps me clarify my thinking.
 - It helps document why certain choices were made, which can aid future
   conversations if these decisions need to be revisited.
 - Others may find this interesting.

Use [template.md](template.md) when adding new entries. This is based on the
[recommendations by Michael Nygard](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions).
